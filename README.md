# Project2-2020
  This GitHub repository consists of a project worked on by Bryan Wilson, Archna Ashish, Rick Shevlin, and Hasti Patel regarding the prevalence of violence in the United States in relation to police officers across the nation.

  We sought to analyze the available data relevant to this topic of various types including, but not limited to, the number of deaths of civilians at the hand of police by state, deaths of police officers in the line of duty, and a variety of factors such as: age, race, gender, location, income levels, and mental health issues. 

  By studying all of the different factors that may affect a person's decision to end someone else's life, we have created a dashboard complete with visualizations that we believe best demonstrate the correlation between a certain group of people and the number of people within that subset that have been killed by police, or while acting in a law enforcement capacity. 
  
  We used Python (Jupyter Notebooks/Pandas) to clean all of our data (.csv's), which were sourced from Kaggle. Then we have created a database in PostgreSQL from those files, and will use this database to create our visualizations. These visuals will be shown using a dashboard that is run on a Flask app, and will be fully interactive, with a plethora of options that will allow the user to view this data based on all the different factors that the data included.
