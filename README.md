# Project2-2020- https://police-encounters-project.herokuapp.com/

  This GitHub repository consists of a project worked on by Bryan Wilson, Archna Ashish, Rick Shevlin, and Hasti Patel regarding the prevalence of violence in the United States in relation to police officers across the nation.

  We sought to analyze the available data relevant to this topic of various types including, but not limited to, the number of deaths of civilians at the hand of police by state, and a variety of factors such as: age, race, gender, location, and mental health issues. 

  By studying all of the different factors that may affect a person's decision to end someone else's life, we have created a dashboard complete with visualizations that we believe best demonstrate the correlation between a certain group of people and the number of people within that subset that have been killed by police, or while acting in a law enforcement capacity. 
  
  We used Python (Jupyter Notebooks/Pandas) to clean all of our data (.csv's), which were sourced from Kaggle. Then we have created a database in PostgreSQL from those files, and used this database to create our visualizations. These visuals ware shown using a dashboard that is run on a Flask app, and is fully interactive, with a plethora of options that allow the user to view the data based on different variables or categories. 
  
  The main dashboard is accessed with the index.html file, and all visualizations are displayed there. All data cleaning procedures have been documented, as well as the files and code used to create the dashboard page, all visuals, and the Flask app. 
  
  This project has been deployed to Heroku so that anyone with internet access can view this project and see the horrific number of people, from a variety of demographic groups, that have unfortunately lost their lives during encounters with the police.
